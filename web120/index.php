     <p>Hi there, 
         My name is Courtney. This is my second quarter at SCCC. I am loving it so far. I am mostly interested in the design side of things. My goal is to become a premier visual web designer. I wouldn't mind doing some development work as well but my main focus is UX or front end web design.</p>
   
    <p>As a <i>young female</i> growing up, I faced challenges deciding what I wanted to pursue as an adult. I didn't seek a direction for my art because I had not been motivated enough in a certain career field. My interest are design and painting. In my off time I enjoy painting murals, canvases and drawing illustrations. I believe that my passion for art will push me to be great with my new found love for web design. I am excited to see what the future holds for me.</p>
